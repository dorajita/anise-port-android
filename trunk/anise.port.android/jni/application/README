Project ANISE
=============

ANISE stands 'A New Implemented Scripting Engine for ai5v'.

The goal of this project is to make a new interpreter for 90's Japanese adventure games made by (c)Elf and (c)Silky's.  Their games have based on the scripting engine called 'AI5V' or 'SILV'(trailing 'V' means their platform, DOS/V).

This project has been progressed on Windows platform with SDL library.  Now finally, I've managed to compile and run it on Linux platform.
